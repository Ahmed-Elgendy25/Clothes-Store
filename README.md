# Clothes Store GitHub Repository

Welcome to the Clothes Store GitHub repository! This repository contains the source code for a simple online clothing store with several key features, including a shopping cart, a carousel for product display, and the ability to select sizes for products. 

## Features

### 1. Shopping Cart

The shopping cart feature allows users to add products to their cart while browsing the store. Users can view their cart at any time, update the quantity or remove items, and proceed to checkout when ready. This feature helps streamline the shopping experience and keeps track of the items users intend to purchase.

### 2. Carousel

The carousel feature provides an engaging way to showcase products to users. It displays a rotating selection of featured or popular items on the store's homepage, making it visually appealing and encouraging users to explore the store further.

### 3. Selecting Sizes

Customers can choose the appropriate size for the products they wish to purchase. This feature ensures that customers can find clothing that fits them correctly and minimizes the risk of returns due to size issues.

### 4. Multiple Quantity Support

Users can add the same product with the same size in different quantities to their cart. This feature allows customers to purchase multiple units of a specific item if needed, providing flexibility in their shopping experience.

### 5. Different Sizes for the Same Product

Customers can also add the same product with different sizes to their cart. This feature is especially useful for clothing items that come in various sizes, allowing customers to order different sizes of the same product in a single transaction.
